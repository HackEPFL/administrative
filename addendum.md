## Budget

_Hackers at EPFL_ is sustained (mostly) by external sponsorships. We are in contact with companies
which embodied the hacking spirit since their inception. They are happy to support our activities
on the EPFL campus, because they will foster creativity and technological excellence--the same
kind of environment nurtured by such companies every single day.

Averaging 2 main events per semester (e.g., hackathons), we need a budget of roughly 20,000.- CHF
per year. We estimate that a full-weekend hackathon requires approximately 4,000.- CHF, to cover
the food expenses of ~50 participants (i.e., 4 meals along the 30 hours of the event).
In total. 16,000.- CHF are reserved for the hackathons, and 4,000.- for smaller events, accessory
expenses and overhead.

At discretion, we also accept donations from the association members, e.g., hardware kits for
workshops, software licenses, books, copyrighted material, etc. but *not* money.


## Benefits from EPFL

_Hackers at EPFL_ wants to reach a wide-spectrum of passionate software developers, tinkerers and,
in general, hackers. Becoming an acknowledged association grants us a higher credibility among the
EPFL members, and the possibility of reaching periodically all the students via the internal
mailing list.
We also expect benefits in terms of reserving rooms for our periodical events (i.e., small rooms
for tutorials, and larger ones for hackathons). On the other hand, we *do not* require a stable
room for the association, as our archival requirements are minimal, and we prefer to rotate our
events among many different buildings (so to reach more people).
Last but not the least, although _Hackers at EPFL_ is already endorsed by many faculty members, we
expect our acknowledgment to drive more interest from professors. We foresee a certain number of
members to be attracted directly by the endorsement of professors during their lectures.


## Benefits to EPFL

EPFL is one of the top IT schools in the world. This result has been achieved raising the bar
higher and higher, year after year, striving for anything but excellence. _Hackers at EPFL_
adopts the same passion for excellence, and tries to distribute it among as many people as
possible. _Hackers at EPFL_ indeed becomes the meeting point for like-minded hackers, who before
could have met only by chance.

Top U.S. universities greatly benefited from nurturing the hacking culture on campus. Starting
from MIT (which spurred the movement), and ranging from Stanford to Berkeley, and many others,
associations of hackers have proved to be invaluable--they were the seed of the open-source
movement, the nest of many incubating startups (later become incredibly successful), the hive
where students honed their coding skills to the max, etc.

It is difficult to assess the net benefit of an association which relies completely on the
creativity and passion of its members, but we are confident that EPFL will become an even better
place if hackers have a place where to share their (open)-knowledge.
