## Mission statement

_Hackers at EPFL_ aims to promote the hacking culture and to foster innovation at EPFL,
one amazing event at a time.
*Make new friends. Make stuff. Make the difference.*


## Goals

_Hackers at EPFL_ wants to establish two kind of events in EPFL:

* Hackathons
  * A hackathon (also known as a hack day, hackfest or codefest) is an event in which
  computer programmers and others in the field of software development, like graphic designers,
  interface designers and project managers collaborate intensively on software projects.
  Occasionally, there is a hardware component as well. 
  * _Hackers at EPFL_ plans to bring 2 hackathons per semester in the EPFL campus, taking care
  of logistics, food, contacts with interested companies, etc. The events will be open also to
  external people, in order to enable cross-pollination, and to strenghten the connections between
  EPFL students and the fertile developer community in Vaud.

* Tutorials
  * New programming languages, framework, and technologies are born everys single day. It is very
  challenging to keep abreast, unless being part of a thrilling community of people who are willing
  to meet periodically and teach each other about the latest and greatest.
  * _Hackers at EPFL_ provides an environment where to propose (and attend) periodic tutorials.
  We expect the scheduling of tutorials to become quickly autonomous and driven solely by the
  members, although the association stays responsible of all the logistic aspects, including food
  and drinks when needed.

On the longer term, _Hackers at EPFL_ can also become part of CoderDojo. Coderdojo is a global
collaboration providing free and open learning to young people, especially in programming
technology. We plan to contribute back to the Lausanne area with our skilled association members,
who will organize tutorials and workshops for younger students. Our goal is to do our part in
motivating young minds towards STEM (an area of study which more dedicated people, year after year).


## Structure

_Hackers at EPFL_ is an inclusive association, which embraces (and encourages) diversity. The
hierarchy is almost completely flat: except a few roles (i.e., President, Vice-President,
treasure) which are needed to officially run the association, each single member will always be
referred to as "hacker" (included the 3 people covering the above mentioned roles).
The official roles will be rotated yearly, and will be elected democratically by all the members.

All the activities will be based on the Do-ocracy concept. Namely, "If you want something done,
do it, but remember to be excellent to each other when doing so." Such philosophy has been
adopted for years by *Noisebridge*, one of most famous hackerspaces in the world. It proves to be
successful when members are excellent, hence it represents our own way to strive for excellence
in both technology and human relations among hackers.

As Do-ocracy is a matter of attitude rather than pure skills, _Hackers at EPFL_ welcomes members
of any knowledge level, provided that they are moved by genuine passion and will to learn.
