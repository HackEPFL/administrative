# Hackers at EPFL - Constitutive General Assembly

Start: 2PM

## What is our goal ?

All attending members of the General Assembly seems to agree on the fact that the goal is promoting the hacking culture inside EPFL. It is important to insist on the definition of the words hack/hackers. We all agree to Wikipedia's definition of the word hacker

> A hacker is a person who enjoys exploring the limits of what is possible, in a spirit of playful cleverness. They may also heavily modify software or hardware of their own computer system. It includes building, rebuilding, modifying, and creating software, electronic hardware, or anything else, either to make it better or faster or to give it added features or to make it do something it was never intended to do.

A hack is therefore just something that is produced by a hacker.

A more accurate description of our goals are described in the Goals.md attachment.

## Finances

Hackers at EPFL is sustained (mostly) by external sponsorships. We are in contact with companies which embodied the hacking spirit since their inception. They are happy to support our activities on the EPFL campus, because they will foster creativity and technological excellence--the same kind of environment nurtured by such companies every single day.

Averaging 2 main events per semester (e.g., hackathons), we need a budget of roughly 20,000.- CHF per year. We estimate that a full-weekend hackathon requires approximately 4,000.- CHF, to cover the food expenses of ~50 participants (i.e., 4 meals along the 30 hours of the event). In total. 16,000.- CHF are reserved for the hackathons, and 4,000.- for smaller events, accessory expenses and overhead.
